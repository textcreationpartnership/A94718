         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Cho≈øen, which hath long lain in Death, by the di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of a Rebellious people: I ≈øay, having not been found faithfull to that Witne≈ø≈øe of God in my own Con≈øcience, which condemneth all deceit; and being much rebuked and condemned for what I have done, I am con≈øtrained in this further Di≈øcovery, that the Simple might be undeceived, and the Envious might be reproved.</p>
            <p>When fir≈øt I was per≈øwaded to write, I had principally 4. things in my Eye: Fir≈øt, my de≈øign was to di≈øcover the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptine≈øs, and the vanity of all that Mini≈øtry, and of all tho≈øe Ways, and Forms of Wor≈øhip, which generally is upheld among≈øt us by the dark mind of tho≈øe who are blind in their under≈øtandings; by which the people, who are in darkne≈ø≈øe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119058:2"/>
are mouri≈øhed in that condition, and the Seed of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, which creates a new heart, and redeems out of ≈øinne, is kept in bondage. And, for this purpo≈øe, I began with a Di≈øcovery of what I was, and how I was led, before I came among≈øt tho≈øe people, who go under the name of <hi>Quakers.</hi> where, I ≈øay, <hi>I was for divers years full of zeal led forth in love to ≈øeek after the knowledge of God and Chri≈øt; for which cau≈øe I ≈øought, if that I could find, tho≈øe wayes and tho≈øe means, which were mo≈øt u≈øeful for the clearing of my Con≈øcience, that I might walk in unity with God by a holy and innocent life: to which end,</hi> I ≈øaid <hi>(in my per≈øwa≈øion) I was led forth with much fervency of ≈øpirit, after tho≈øe teachers which were e≈øteemd of among≈øt the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me≈øt Profe≈ø≈øors, as men inlightned with the ≈øpirit of God: in which way I laboured, had there been a po≈ø≈øibility to apprehend the true knowledge and mind of God: but not finding a po≈ø≈øibility in that way, to apprehend the thing ≈øought for, but in≈øtead thereof, un≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and diver≈øity of Opinions, confu≈øion in Societies, things which are at perfect enmity with God, who is one Spirit, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be divided;</hi> I ≈øaid, <hi>I left them as they were, and all that ever I received from them; and ≈øought further, if that I might find the way of Redemption, from under that heavy burthen, which lay upon me:</hi> in which ≈øeeking, (as I have ≈øpoken) <hi>I found ≈øuch who declared against all ≈øin who≈øe order and manner of teaching, and Duties, were united, compleat in one, they being the fruits of one Mind by which they were joyned in one Spirit, and ≈øo judges and witne≈ø≈øes for God, again≈øt all tho≈øe fal≈øe Chri≈øts, and fal≈øe Prophets, who were going forth into the world, who≈øe doctrine was of Man, who</hi> (having ≈ølain the Witne≈øs) <hi>knew not the Word of Life; therefore uncapable of edifying the People,</hi> and ≈øo <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of the Letter, and not of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, my purpo≈øe was, to extingui≈øh them, who are ever learning the people, and them≈øelves, and yet never able to know the truth; and withall, to confirm tho≈øe who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ≈øuch a Witne≈øs again≈øt all ≈øin, <hi>whom I concluded were the people of God;</hi> who≈øe doctrine and life, I have not denied [by words] in any particular, of all what I then di≈øcovered, except in tho≈øe things of civil Expre≈ø≈øions, and Carriages, which otherwi≈øe I called Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>A ≈øecond thing, which my mind was directed in, was, to invite, or per≈øwade ≈øuch who were ≈øtrangers to tho≈øe people,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119058:3"/>
and their ways, who are called (of men) <hi>Quakers,</hi> That they ≈øhould inquire after that Truth which is profe≈ø≈øed by them; for which end, I di≈øcovered them as ≈øuch who were <hi>united in one mind,</hi> and ≈øo <hi>acted on in their duties, who≈øe Mini≈øtry was one, being guided therein by one Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. and then <hi>I relate a Di≈øcour≈øe mini≈øtred by one of tho≈øe people, with the effects which that Di≈øcour≈øe wrought upon my Spirit; together, with what I had received before from tho≈øe people;</hi> as the Di≈øcour≈øe holds ≈øoul; al≈øo <hi>of my orderly forbearance, untill I had received a more cleare under≈øtanding, before I complyed with them; in which time, I received a further Witne≈øs:</hi> And ≈øo I go on, <hi>di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of their Judgment;</hi> without which knowledge, there is none can ever come to ≈øee the Redemption of their Souls. The≈øe things being con≈øidered, I was per≈øwaded, that ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that end might be effected, for which purpo≈øe they were di≈øcovered.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid open my Under≈øtanding, I began in the third place, to give warning unto all, who may be per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to receive the Word of Truth; that when convinced in their under≈øtandings, where that Word of Life, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems out of ≈øinne, is to be found: That they con≈øider and examine in them≈øelves where withall they are led, that they run not before they are ≈øent, but to abide in the watch, that ≈øo they lo≈øe not their Guide, and bring in Darkne≈ø≈øe upon their Spirit: And for this cau≈øe, I di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <hi>what evill attended me through the ha≈øtine≈øs of my mind, in that I gave not heed to that obedience whereunto I was called; which evill I wholly took upon my ≈øelf, as being the work of my≈øelf:</hi> with purpo≈øe therein, to unvail that Darkne≈ø≈øe, which was upheld, in many, by their mi≈ø-under≈øtanding of the cau≈øe of tho≈øe things, which generally had pa≈ø≈øed abroad concerning me,</p>
            <p>A fourth end, was to di≈øcover tho≈øe things, practi≈øed by tho≈øe people who are in that way: in which I conceived there was no evill in the not performance thereof, And in re≈øpect of which things onely, I my ≈øelf did ≈øeparate from them, <hi>which things were none other, but a denial of tho≈øe things, which generally is called, Civil Carriage to Civil Per≈øons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe four grounds, being the chiefe≈øt ends of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe in writing, I was wel ≈øatisfied in what work I had done,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119058:3"/>
though yet I appeared a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor (in re≈øpect to my ≈øelf) for which cau≈øe having received knowledge, that my ends are generally fru≈øtrated, I am con≈øtrained (as I have ≈øaid) in this further appearance to the world.</p>
            <p>Now that tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion (in re≈øpect to my ≈øelf) was thus, in the con≈øideration of what condition I had brought my ≈øelf unto, ≈øince fir≈øt I became affected with tho≈øe people, who are called of men Quakers: My minde was directed (as I have ≈øaid) for the an≈øwering of tho≈øe ends which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, in which work I was glad; in that I was of any ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to appear therein; but yet I would ≈øcarcely have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the world, as one who ≈øhould di≈øcover him≈øelf in ≈øuch a work, that I might not be looked upon as one my ≈øelf, with tho≈øe people among≈øt whom I was, le≈øt the ≈øame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and lo≈ø≈øe of friend≈øhip from men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which once was my reward for the obedience of that faith, which the world knoweth not, I ≈øay, le≈øt ≈øelf ≈øhould thus have bin de≈øtroyed, I ≈øought ≈øecretly to di≈øcover my minde ≈øomething in ob≈øcurity; but yet I made provi≈øion, that ≈øuch who were not ingaged, but would read and under≈øtand my witne≈ø≈øe with a ≈øingle eye, that ≈øuch might ≈øee the end of my minde, according as before is di≈øcovered, which thing was unto me for the pre≈øent, a ≈øatisfaction in what I had done.</p>

            <p>The≈øe things being laid open, my Judgment was, that although tho≈øe names were u≈øed in my book, yet the people would have con≈øidered the thing, as it was di≈øcovered from me, and not in a generall ≈øence, as a thing proceeding from their Judgments, who≈øe Names were unto it, and ≈øo another thing than it ≈øpeaks.</p>
            <p>But now I am mi≈øtaken in my Judgment; and on the contrary, a Divi≈øion among≈øt men concerning the thing, ≈øuch who are affected in the way of tho≈øe, who≈øe Names appear in what I have done, they and the≈øe who have appeared, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to them≈øelves a ≈øatisfaction of that, which the thing ≈øpeaks not of, but condemns; as al≈øo it condemns them and their way.</p>

A ≈øecond ≈øort there are, in whom there is no prejudice unto the one, or unto the other, but receives the thing as it is ≈øingly, and they give witne≈øs, that ≈øurely a thing could not have appeared more (in ≈øuch a ca≈øe as this was) on the behalf of tho≈øe people, who go under the name of Quakers, than that did. And a third ≈øort have been un≈øatisfied, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it ≈øpeaks for the one, or for the other.</p>
            <p>The≈øe things I received knowledge of, time after time, from divers who≈øe mindes were thus different in the thing: but in the con≈øideration, that there were ≈øuch who ≈øaw my minde, and meaning as it was, and ≈øo received my witne≈ø≈øe.

            <p>Now <hi>James Naylor,</hi> that per≈øon from whom there was di≈øcovered in an≈øwer unto the thing, by what I now am gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to under≈øtand, was otherwi≈øe minded, in re≈øpect of ≈øome things, than what I at fir≈øt under≈øtood of him, which was thus. When having read his Book, and ≈øeeing much of the Spirit of Judgment upon me, and all tho≈øe who appeared with me, and that we were by him united in one, as ≈øuch who were joyned in enmity again≈øt the light of Chri≈øt; and that he looked upon them as one with me, and I with them, in the whole of what was di≈øcovered, and ≈øo ≈øecret ≈ømiters again≈øt the truth: the thing being ≈øomething in ob≈øcurity-Seeing the≈øe things, I was moved, and ≈øought to finde what ≈øhould be the cau≈øe why he appeared in ≈øuch a Spirit; for I ≈øaw that either he was much mi≈øtaken, or el≈øe I was greatly deceived in what I had done; but when having ≈øearched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again, I could not ≈øee that his judgment was true upon me, except in that, of my receiving other witne≈ø≈øe to what I had di≈øcovered than my own: the extent of which deed, I ≈øaw, as to me, little evill in; for that I had di≈øcovered my Witne≈ø≈øe, according as I have before related, in which, if well con≈øidered, there was no advantage for them, or any that might affect them: Neither could I ≈øee his Judgment to be true, in ≈øome things, concerning tho≈øe who appeared
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119058:5"/>
with me, in that; he concluded them as one with me in what I had done &amp; as privy to what was contained in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or the Epi≈øtle. Now the≈øe things being ≈øo by what I knew concerning their knowledge of the Title, or the Epi≈øtle, or could apprehend concerning the other, I was much troubled concerning him, and that work he appeared in: upon which, I con≈øidered with my ≈øelf what I were be≈øt to do, if to return an an≈øwer, or if to let it re≈øt ≈øilent: in which con≈øideration, (my ≈øpirit being moved) I was per≈øwaded to return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer: for as yet I was di≈øplea≈øed, in that I ≈øaw my de≈øigns were wholly broken in many things, which in ob≈øcurity I had di≈øcovered with purpo≈øe to advance the truth (though I would ≈øcarcely have been ≈øeen in ≈øo doing) and ≈øo I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented as a per≈øon unworthy, and my work, as confu≈øion, though other things, ≈øpoken in more plainne≈øs, appeared for me as a true Witne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Now, having ≈øome advantage for the effecting of this work, and the more, by ≈øome clouded expre≈ø≈øions; which yet being di≈øcovered as my mind, that the Ju≈øt might not be condemned, I was therein ≈øatisfied, and ≈øo directed in a dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle anger again≈øt the per≈øon <hi>James Naylor,</hi> though (at the pre≈øent) I thought I was guided therein, by obedience to the Ju≈øt in me, in that I made ≈øome provi≈øion to ≈øecure the people and their way, though I judged his per≈øon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his deed: But when after, what I had thus done was publi≈øhed to the world, my mind being ≈øetled; in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of them ≈øeriou≈øly, I was ≈ømitten in my judgment, and much reproved, for that I ≈øaw an envious ≈øpirit had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in me: Then was there given me clearly to ≈øee the right mind in which <hi>James Naylor</hi> was led, in the an≈øwering what I had di≈øcovered: by which I ≈øaw, truly, much of what he ≈øpake, to be another thing, then what I formerly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and his Judgments, in a great mea≈øure, to be e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed in truth; for, in that I ≈øpake in ob≈øcurity, <hi>I</hi> ≈øaw <hi>I</hi> laid a ≈øtumbling block before the truth; and in that <hi>I</hi> engaged others, this my ob≈øcurity became a ≈ønare to tho≈øe, by whom they were affected: and ≈øo <hi>I</hi> receiving their te≈øtimony, though not one with them in the thing, nor they one with me: yet in re≈øpect of the end, which is effected by their means, <hi>I</hi> was overcome, and ≈øo became one with them, in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119058:5"/>
that end which the thing it ≈øelf doth condemn: And thus (through my vanity) we all became ≈øecret ≈ømiters again≈øt the truth; which things being made known, <hi>I</hi> could do no le≈øs but di≈øcover that the burden of my ≈øpirit might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and that the Ju≈øt might not ≈øuffer by my meanes, knowing there is a time in which all ≈øecrets ≈øhall be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and every deed ≈øhall receive its own reward: Therefore have <hi>I</hi> rather cho≈øen to own the Condemnation, that the truth might have its free cour≈øe without interruption, and to pa≈øs by what reproach might be ca≈øt upon me, for that <hi>I</hi> have appeared herein, knowing that unto the truth <hi>I</hi> am made manife≈øt, by whom <hi>I</hi> am witne≈ø≈øed, that if by any means <hi>I</hi> could have put by this work, <hi>I</hi> ≈øhould have been much glad (with re≈øpect to my ≈øelf) therein: But where the blame is, my due, I mu≈øt receive it (from all) as my due, and therein re≈øt ≈øilent: And for that deed of engaging the Mini≈øters, I am ≈øorry (as I have ≈øaid) that I ≈øhould be ≈øo fooli≈øhly led forth as I was therein, both in re≈øpect to them, and al≈øo to the thing in hand, by which my whole purpo≈øe (having appeared ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in ob≈øcurity) generally became void, and ≈øo deceived my ≈øelf and them al≈øo.</p>
            <p>But now I would freely ≈øpeak my mind, and utter words in knowledge, that the ju≈øt might receive its own due; yet not in the lea≈øt envy, with re≈øpect to one or the other; but in plainne≈ø≈øe, as I have received: Therefore, my de≈øire is, that none would receive to them≈øelves any offence in this work: but if in any, (as I have before ≈øaid) in what formerly I have done; for verily (as I have ≈øpoken) often-times I was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in ≈øeeking in tho≈øe ways, which the prime≈øt Profe≈ø≈øors of the≈øe Times, who were led by the Letter, were guided in, I ran from one to another, from Mountain to Hill, I ≈øought to find, but could not: onely I increa≈øed in wi≈ødome (the work of my own labour) and this wi≈ødome, being of the fle≈øh, was plea≈øant and delightful, and ≈øo I thought it was the My≈øtery of the Spirit: But yet ≈øtill this wi≈ødome was unto me but little ≈øatisfaction, though I laboured very ≈øtrictly in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what I had learned from the Law of the Letter, which was the end of that Mini≈øtry, by which I was guided; for there was ≈øomething yet in me that was un≈øatisfied, which lay under a great burthen, which all the wi≈ødom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

in my ≈øelf, and in tho≈øe my Learners, was not, in the lea≈øt, able to ≈øatisfie: Yet, in that time, I could not ≈øee the cau≈øe of the≈øe things; but when after I came to hear tho≈øe people who are called (of men) <hi>Quakers,</hi> in a ≈øhort time I was clearly convinced, and given to ≈øee, the end of all my former labours, and the cau≈øe of my troubled ≈øpirit: for they being redeemed out of the wi≈ødome, out of the imaginations of the brain, which is ≈øen≈øual, and of the fle≈øh, &amp;c. they ≈øpake by and from that Spirit of Life in them, by which they were redeemed; and ≈øo their words, being from the Life, reached to the Life, the Seed of the Righteous, which lay under the dark Mind burdened, and groaning for a deliverance. And here was that My≈øtery that is of God, <hi>which mini≈øters to the Spirits in Pri≈øon:</hi> Which being made known, I was not in the lea≈øt able to gain-≈øay: And then I ≈øaw, indeed, that <hi>Word of Faith which reveals the everla≈øting Go≈øpel</hi> to be <hi>near in the Mouth and in the Heart;</hi> and that <hi>Circumci≈øion which is of God, was of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter; who≈øe prai≈øe was not of Man, but of God.</hi> But now for any to judge, that all, or any of tho≈øe di≈øtractions, and workes of deceit, which are delcared by me, as the effects of my di≈øobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the light; I ≈øay, for any to judge of them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe than they are, and to ca≈øt them as a reproach upon the light, it is vain and evill, and a thing contrary to my whole mind: for that (as I have ≈øpoken) I dare not, neither can I ≈øay, but that the whole cau≈øe of all tho≈øe evils, was of my ≈øelf: But though my ≈øufferings was great, when after I came in this way, yet I ≈øaw much good was the end of all, Peace and Re≈øt in Spirit, according to the mea≈øure of Grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which I never could ≈øee or attain unto, by all tho≈øe means, and in all tho≈øe ways which formerly I was led forth in: But to ≈øpeak in truth (that the Ju≈øt might receive its own) wherein I have at any time with-drawn from that grace I then lived in, therein I have refu≈øed the good, and cho≈øe the evill, which works I mu≈øt acknowledge, as the works of my ≈øelf in the hour of judgment.</p>
            <p>And now, I hope that none will judge of me, as an Offence to the Law of Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, but as one that e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Law in Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe (though much again≈øt my own ≈øelf-will) and have I cho≈øen to acknowledge that thing

which is rejected of among≈øt men, becau≈øe my Con≈øcience beareth me witne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øeals to the truth thereof?
